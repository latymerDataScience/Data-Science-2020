A place to upload your code and examine others'

Hi Guys - when you upload code, upload it into the "Python files" directory, using your name. If you don't do all the tasks in one file, make a new directory (with the title of your name) and then upload each of the files into there. You make a new directory by doing the following - Add file -> Create New File -> In file name type the name of directory + /.gitkeep. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

The files for all the tasks will eventually be uploaded into the "Data Source Files" directory

There is an "issues" tab provided by GitHub. Here, you can raise issues to the group, if you want help on a certain bit of code, or have a question about someone else's. Depending on how many of you actually use this, me, or another will respond to your issue :)

Please don't change the GitHub account password.

At the moment the default account email is a gmail account I created, but if you want to change it to your school one, then feel free to in the account settings.
